GymFC is flight control tuning framework with a focus in attitude control.
GymFC was first introduced in the [manuscript](http://wfk.io/docs/gymfc.pdf) "Reinforcement learning for UAV attitude control" in which a simulator was used to
synthesize neuro-flight attitude controllers that exceeded the performance of a traditional PID controller.
Since the projects initial release it has matured to become a modular
framework
for tuning flight control systems, not only for synthesizing neuro-flight
controllers but also tuning traditional controllers as well.
GymFC is the primary method for developing controllers to be used in the worlds
first neural network supported
flight control firmware [Neuroflight](https://wfk.io/neuroflight).
Details of the project and its architecture are best described in Wil Koch's
[thesis](http://wfk.io/docs/WilliamKochThesisFINAL.pdf) "Flight Controller Synthesis Via Deep Reinforcement Learning".

# Features

* Support for IMU, ESC and battery sensors
* Aircraft agnostic - support for any type of aircraft just configure number of
  actuators and sensors.
* Digital twin independence - digital twin is developed external to GymFC
  allowing separate versioning.

# Installation

Note, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS are the only OS currently supported. Please submit a PR for the README.md if you are able to get it working on another platform. To ensure accurate and stable simulations it is recommended to use DART with Gazebo. This requires Gazebo to be installed from source. For more information please see this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3NyFU0bVT0).  We have found these versions to work well together,

1. Compile and install DART v6.9.2 from source [here](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/v6.9.2) [(Insallation instructions)](http://dartsim.github.io/install_dart_on_ubuntu.html). Make sure you checkout the correct tag (tags/v6.9.2) when you clone the repo. Do not install the optional dependencies (they may work, just haven't been fully tested).
2. Compile and install [Gazebo 10](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_from_source&cat=install). Once you clone the repo, remember to switch to the gazebo 10 release by running `hg up gazebo10`. You do not need the optional gazebo dependencies
    NOTE: you may need to install lsb_release if you are installing within a docker container `apt install lsb-release`.
    NOTE: if you don't have mercurial, install with `apt install mercurial`
3. (Optional) It is suggested to set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). From the project root, `python3 -m venv env`. This will create an environment named `env` which will be ignored by git. To enable the virtual environment, `source env/bin/activate` and to deactivate, `deactivate`.
4. From root directory of this project, `pip3 install .` If you plan to work with the GymFC source code you will want to install it in development mode, `pip3 install -e .`
5. You will also need to build the plugin manually by running the script `gymfc/envs/assets/gazebo/plugins/build_plugin.sh`.
6. Confirm `SetupFile` in `gymfc.ini` is pointing to the correct location.


# Setting up an aircraft model
Once you have the package installed, you need to setup an aircraft to simulate in Gazebo. The current prebuilt models are [solo](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-digitaltwin-solo) and [NF1](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc/tree/thesis-work/modules). Currently, solo is not functional and needs development help. NF1 is currently working in the simulator. Clone the desired model to a logical location on your computer. You will pass the path to the `.sdf` file to GymFC when using the library.

### Directory Layout
GymFC expects your model to have the following Gazebo style directory structure:
```
model_name/
  model.config
  model.sdf
  plugins/
    build/
```

where the `plugin` directory contains the  source for your plugins and the
`build` directory will contain the built binary plugins. GymFC will, at
runtime, add the build directory to the Gazebo plugin path so they can be found and loaded.

NOTE! If you are using external plugins create soft links
to each .so file in the build directory.

### Configure Aircraft Plugins
The solo and NF1 models depend on the plugins in the [gymfc-aircraft-plugins repo](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-aircraft-plugins). To setup these plugins:
1. Create the `plugins` and `plugins/build` directories in your model path according to the directory layout above.
2. Clone the [gymfc-aircraft-plugins repo](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-aircraft-plugins).
3. Build the plugins. From the root directory of the repo, run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```
4. Symlink the `.so` files in the build directory to the plugins build directory within the model directory:
```
cp --symbolic-link *.so INSERT_MODEL_DIRECTORY/plugins/build/
```
5. Test that the model is configured correctly by running `tests/test_axis.py`


# Getting Started

The simplest environment can be created with,

```python
from gymfc.envs.fc_env import FlightControlEnv
class MyEnv(FlightControlEnv):
    def __init__(self, aircraft_config, config=None, verbose=False):
        super().__init__(aircraft_config, config_filepath=config, verbose=verbose)
```

By inheriting FlightControlEnv you now have access to the `step_sim` and
`reset` functions. If you want to create an OpenAI gym you also need to inherit
this class e.g.,

```python

from gymfc.envs.fc_env import FlightControlEnv
import gym
class MyOpenAIEnv(FlightControlEnv, gym.Env):
```

For simplicity the GymFC environment takes as input a single `aircraft_config` which is the file location of your aircraft model  `model.sdf`. The SDF declares all the visualizations, geometries and plugins for the aircraft.







# Available User Provided Modules

To increase flexibility and provide a universal tuning framework, the user must
provide four modules: A flight controller, a flight control tuner, environment
interface, and digital twin. (Note: for neuro-flight controllers typically the
flight controller and tuner are one in the same, e.g., OpenAI baselines) This will expand the flight control research that
can be done with GymFC. For example this opens up the possibilities for tuning
PID gains using optimization strategies such as GAs and PSO. The goal is to provide a collection of open source
modules for users to mix and match. If you have created your own, please let us
know and we will add it below.

## Tuners

* [OpenAI baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)

## Environments

WIP

## Digital Twins

* [Solo](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-digitaltwin-solo) Needs help!

## Motor models

* [Element blade theory](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-aircraft-plugins)


# Custom User Modules

### Digital Twin


## SDF

Each model.sdf **must** declare the `libAircraftConfigPlugin.so` plugin.
This is a dummy plugin allowing us to set arbitrary configuration data.
An example configuration may look like this,

```xml
<plugin name="config" filename="libAircraftConfigPlugin.so">
    <!-- Define the total number of motors that shall be controlled -->
    <motorCount>4</motorCount>

    <!-- The center of thrust must be defined in order to attach the aircraft
model to the simulation. The offset will in relation to this specified link -->
    <centerOfThrust>
        <link>battery</link>
        <offset>0 0 0.058</offset>
    </centerOfThrust>
    <!-- Specify all the sensors this aircraft supports. Valid sensor types
are "imu, esc, and battery" -->
    <sensors>
      <sensor type="imu">
          <enable_angular_velocity>true</enable_angular_velocity>
          <enable_linear_acceleration>true</enable_linear_acceleration>
          <enable_orientation>true</enable_orientation>
      </sensor>
      <!--
      <sensor type="esc">
            <enable_angular_velocity>true</enable_angular_velocity>
            <enable_temperature>true</enable_temperature>
            <enable_current>true</enable_current>
      </sensor>
      <sensor type="battery">
          <enable_voltage>true</enable_voltage>
          <enable_current>true</enable_current>
      </sensor>
        -->
    </sensors>
</plugin>
```

### API
GymFC communicates with the aircraft through Google Protobuf messages. At a
minimum the aircraft must subscribe to motor commands and publish IMU messages

#### GymFC to Aircraft

*Topic* /aircraft/command/motor
*Message Type* [MotorCommand.proto]()

#### Aircraft to GymFC

*Topic* /aircraft/sensor/imu

*Message Type* Imu.proto


*Topic* /aircraft/sensor/esc

*Message Type* EscSensor.proto
